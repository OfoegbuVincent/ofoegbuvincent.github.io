# 🦏 Rhino Hunt Forensics Analysis

## 📖 Overview
This repository contains my complete analysis of the **Rhino Hunt** digital forensics challenge from the [NIST CFReDS archive](https://cfreds-archive.nist.gov/dfrws/Rhino_Hunt.html).  
The goal was to examine a USB image and network traces to recover hidden rhino images and answer investigative questions.
